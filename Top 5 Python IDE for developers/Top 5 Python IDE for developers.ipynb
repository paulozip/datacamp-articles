    "IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It's a coding tool which allows you to write, test and debug your code in an easier way, as they typically offer code completion or code insight by highlighting, resource management, debugging tools,... And even though the IDE is a strictly defined concept, it's starting to be redefined as other tools such as notebooks start gaining more and more features that traditionally belong to IDEs. For example, debugging your code is also possible in Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can probably most clearly see this evolution in the results of the <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/insights/survey/2016#technology-development-environments'>Stack Overflow Developer Survey</a> below, which also includes these new tools, next to the traditional IDEs that you might already know; They all fall under the section \"development environment\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of all the features that IDEs have to offer, they are extremely useful for development: they make your coding more comfortable and this is no different for data science. However, given the fact that there aren't only the traditional IDEs to consider, but also new tools, such as notebooks, you might be wondering which IDE to use when you're just starting out with data science.

    "The truth is that you can code in almost any software, from prompt command to Windows notepad, but you may also want a proper programming environment which combines coding facility with a debugging environment. So why would or do you choose a traditional IDE instead of, for example, a notepad? The answer would be practicality. For instance, imagine that you are coding in any text editor like Windows notepad. When your code is ready, you'll need to run it. You can't execute your program in a text editor like this, so you must use a prompt command to do it. Rather than use two different programs, wouldn't better have it all in just one place? That's what an IDE is ready for.\n",

    "\n",
    "Isn't that weird?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, many text editors can be used as an IDE if you make use of plugins: when you're working with Notepad++, for example, you can use these plugins such as the <a href='https://sourceforge.net/projects/npp-plugins/files/DBGP%20Plugin/'>DBGP for Notepad++</a> to install a debugger in the application, allowing you to run and analyze your code directly in your favorite text editor. \n",
    "\n",
    "And this immediately explains why text editors can be so popular: they not only offer you the blank slate, but they also give you the option to add features that you might need. This stands in clear contrast with IDEs such as Visual Studio, Spyder, and Rodeo, where these features are built in and you don't need to install anything else to start developing, but where the learning curve might be a little bit steeper for users."
